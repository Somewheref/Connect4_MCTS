# Connect4_MCTS

an implementation of Connect4 agent using MCTS(Monte Carlo Tree Search)


### quick notes

* When playing with ai, in the directory it will create .json files that stores the data that ai learns during the play. Do mind its size! It can get real big.
* If you think the computer is too stupid, you can select option2 (computer-computer) before play so that it gets stronger.
* Computers also learns while it is playing with you.
* Decrease the exploration constant (C) in MCTS.py if you want the agent to act greedly.

On that, please enjoy! Welcome any suggestions that could make this agent work better!
